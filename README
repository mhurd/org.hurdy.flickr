# org.hurdy.flickr

A clojure wrapper around Flickr API calls used to showcase photos, early days, just playing around with 
some basic image processing that calculates the image's average and complementary RGB colours. No persistence yet it just
grabs the URIs on start-up for the latest 500 photos on my Flickr account and keeps them in-memory for the time-being.

NOTE: Please be nice and replace my flickr API credentials with yours...
